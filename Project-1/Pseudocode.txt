You will write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 8 characters from user input. If
the string has only the characters from '0' to '9' and from 'a' to 'f' and from 'A' to 'F', the
program prints out the unsigned decimal integer corresponding to the hexadecimal number
in the string. Otherwise, the program prints out the message of "Invalid hexadecimal
number.".



Ask for user input
Check to make sure user input is less than 8 characters
Else print "Invalid hexadecimal number.”

Validate string characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)
Else print "Invalid hexadecimal number.”

Loop through characters 
return decimal integer for characters
