MIPS Programming Assignment 1 - CompOrg 1

Write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 8 characters from user input. If the string has only the characters from '0' to '9' and from 'a' to 'f' and from 'A' to 'F', the program prints out the unsigned decimal integer corresponding to the hexadecimal number 
in the string. Otherwise, the program prints out the message of "Invalid hexadecimal number.



MIPS Programming Assignment 2 - CompOrg 1

You will write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 1000 characters from user input.
The string consists of one or more substrings separated by comma. Spaces or tabs at the
beginning or end or around commas are ignored, those spaces or tabs should stay. For each
of the substring, if it is a hexadecimal string, i.e. it has only the characters from '0' to '9'
and from 'a' to 'f' and from 'A' to 'F', and it is of no more than 8 characters, the program
prints out the corresponding unsigned decimal integer. If the hexadecimal string has more
than 8 characters, the program prints out the string of “too large”. Otherwise, the program
prints out the string of “NaN”. The output should be separated by commas in the same way
as the input.

The program must have 3 subprograms.
